<div  class="w3-card w3-black w3-border-black w3-padding">
    <p >Hi, my name is Chavoughn Vassell. A little boy born in Kingston, Jamacia. I relocated to the England, UK when I was 9 years old with my family. 
        My childhood here allowed me to build emotional and social relationships with friends whom I made.
        Without them, I would not have understood the feeling of feeling frustrated with the education system that have been put in place. </p>
        <p>I have worked in residential children homes and found
        that a lot of them lack resources that could easily be within their grasps. 
        Here, I understood that there is a need for workbook. It is important to always be improving on yourself, however you can. 
        I beleive my workbooks can aid in someway. 
        You can find my workbooks on the link above. If you find yourself wanting to play a game (Working on) or read free material(Update coming soon), you can do so above.

        <hr>
        <p>All of the blog content that I have posted, were posted back in 2015 of how my feelings have been at the time. 
            I have changed throughout the years but I know it may be unsettling to some people. I have posted these blogs on this site because I believe that throughout the blog post that I will add, you will see the changes I have added to my personality over the years.
            It is essential to see the post in full.
